We are an alliance of global developers, hackers, data scientists, professors and general modern technology experts. We believe that legal 3D printed guns pose a threat to the people around the world and are working on open source Artificial Intelligence and 3D Printing technologies to help  parents protect their children whilst they use the internet and assist website owners classify & remove unwanted gun designs from their websites.

Through the use of Artificial Intelligence we will provide free tools, services and source codes to those who want to protect themselves and the people around them from the dangers of open source 3D weapons.
